## TODO

### Overview
Widget that allows the user to:
1. file-open an image or pdf on their hard drive and display in viewer
2. upload this file to the server on request
3. download a image or pdf from the server and display in viewer

External dependencies:
1. ViewerJS - to display pdfs in browser with useful controls
2. UploadJS - would like to get rid of this and use an async API
